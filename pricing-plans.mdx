### How do image credits work?
Image credits are renewed monthly on your billing date. For example, if you subscribe on January 15th, your credits will refresh on February 15th.

### What happens if I use all my monthly images?
Currently, you'll need to wait until your next billing cycle for your credits to refresh. We're developing a feature that will allow you to purchase additional credits when you exceed your plan's limit - stay tuned for updates!

### Can I upgrade my plan at any time?
Yes, you can upgrade to a higher tier plan at any time. The new features will be available immediately.

### What happens to my trained models if I downgrade?
Your trained models remain accessible, but you won't be able to train new ones until you're within your plan's limits.

### Is support available for all plans?
Yes, all plans include support, with higher tiers receiving priority assistance.
