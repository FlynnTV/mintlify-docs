Creating the perfect prompt is essential for generating stunning images with Flynn's AI. A well-crafted prompt provides clear instructions and descriptive details to guide the AI in producing high-quality outputs.

## Tips for Writing Effective Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the subject, setting, and mood of your desired image.

2. **Include Details**: Use adjectives and technical terms to describe lighting, composition, and style.

3. **State the Format**: Mention the type of photography or illustration (e.g., lifestyle, editorial, product).

4. **Use Professional Terminology**: Reference camera models, lenses, or artistic techniques to achieve specific results.

## Good Prompt Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the sections to include in a prompt:

1. **[Type of Shot]**: Define the type of photography or image (e.g., portrait, lifestyle, product, editorial, cinematic, abstract).
2. **[Style/Genre]**: Describe the visual style or genre (e.g., minimalist, professional, artistic, high fashion, vintage).
3. **[Lighting]**: Specify the type and mood of lighting (e.g., natural, studio, dramatic, soft, neon, cinematic).
4. **[Scene/Setting]**: Include the location, objects, or environment details (e.g., urban street, rustic table, lush garden).
5. **[Camera/Artistic Techniques]**: (Optional) Add references to camera equipment or techniques for a professional touch (e.g., Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.2 lens, shallow depth of field).
