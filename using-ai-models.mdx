Flynn's image generation system allows you to easily switch between different AI models through the image creation configurator. This guide will help you understand how to select and use the available models.

## Accessing the Model Selector

1. Navigate to the image creation interface
2. Look for the **Model** dropdown in the configurator panel
3. Click to reveal all available models

## Available Models

The Model dropdown will display:

- **Flynn's Grid**: Our advanced development model
- **Flynn's Disc**: Our optimized, speed-focused model
- **Custom Models**: Any custom AI models you've created or imported

## Selecting a Model

### Standard Models

1. Open the Model dropdown
2. Choose either Flynn's Grid or Flynn's Disc based on your needs:
   - Select **Flynn's Grid** for maximum detail and complex compositions
   - Select **Flynn's Disc** for faster generation and portrait-focused work

### Custom Models

If you've created custom AI models:
- They will appear in the same dropdown below the standard models
- Custom models are marked with a special indicator
- Select them just like you would a standard model

## Model-Specific Settings

Each model may have slightly different optimal settings:

### Flynn's Grid
- Works best with detailed prompts
- Supports higher inference steps for maximum detail
- Excellent with higher guidance scale values

### Flynn's Disc
- Performs well with concise prompts
- Requires fewer inference steps
- Optimal at moderate guidance scale values

## Tips for Model Selection

- **Test Different Models**: Try both models with the same prompt to see which gives better results
- **Consider Generation Time**: Flynn's Disc will generate images faster than Flynn's Grid
- **Match to Project Needs**: Choose based on whether speed or detail is more important
- **Monitor Resources**: Flynn's Disc uses fewer system resources

## Working with Custom Models

If you use custom models:
- Review any specific requirements or optimal settings
- Note any special prompt formats they may require
- Consider documenting which custom models work best for different types of images

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**:
   - Begin with Flynn's Disc for initial concepts
   - Switch to Flynn's Grid when you need more detail

2. **Keep Track**:
   - Note which model you used for successful generations
   - This helps when recreating similar images later

3. **Experiment**:
   - Try the same prompt with different models
   - Compare results to understand each model's strengths

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Verify your model selection matches your needs
- Check if you're using recommended settings for that model
- For custom models, ensure they're properly loaded and configured

*Remember: The best model choice depends on your specific project requirements. Don't hesitate to experiment with different models to find what works best for your needs.*
